### HelloðŸ‘‹! I'm Nilay

### "Everything can be improved" - Clarence W. Barron

I have 2.4 yrs of experience working on Dell Boomi integration platform and SAP Successfactors as an Integration Consultant & Developer. Later, I decided to dive into the field of machine learning/data science and here I am.

Now, I'm newly graduated(Business Analytics) from Seneca college, Toronto and I'm looking for gaining knowledge and experience in the field of Data science, Machine Learning and Analytics. I'm always looking for new things to learn and implement. Any guidance with learning is greatly appreciated.
